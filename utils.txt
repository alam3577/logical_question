1.bcrypt.js (hash. compare)
---------------------------
                 A library to help you hash passwords.
   hash(plain_password, 8)
   ----------------------
      It takes two arguments 
           1) Plainpassword
           
           2) saltRounds
              ----------
                   number of rounds we want to perform.
                   8 rounds perferred good.
   
          






Installation types
-------------------

        1.npm i nodemon --save-dev
        -------------------------
                 It will install nodemon for development version only.

        2.npm i nodemon --save
        ---------------------
                 It will install nodemon for development version too.

        3.npm i nodemon -g --save
        ------------------------
            It will install nodemon globally.
            
Error Types
------------

       1.Syntax Error
       --------------
                -> Simple syntax error which can be easily Identifed
                
       2.Runetime Error
       ----------------
                -> Read error message carefully to find solution.
             
       3.Logical Error
       ---------------
                -> So, difficult to find 
                
                Nodejs debugger play an importent role to find logical error 
                ----------------------------------------------------------------
                
                -> Run -> Debugging -> select node (shortcut f5).
                -> To use Debugger you need to add breakpoint. Is se hoga ye ki app breakpoint tak check kar paogay k appka code sahe se chala ya nahe.
                -> Also please go in view and select debug option, So you can see local as well as global variable too. and many more.
                
                To restart the debugging process automatically as nodemon done for that we need to move to following path.
                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                
                -> Run -> Add Configuration -> select node 
                -> add these in json.
                          
                          {
                             "restart": true,
                             "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon"
                          }
                
                Important Points
                ----------------
                    1. Start Debugging from app.js
                    2. It is main file 
                    
                    Syntax and runtime errors
                    --------------------------
                                at least throw a hopefully helpful error message and you should read these messages and look at the line numbers they give you                                     because that often helps you find out what went wrong and how to fix this. 
                                
                   Logical errors 
                   ---------------
                               often are more difficult to fix but you can fix them often with a lot of testing and possibly the help of the debugger which you                                  learned
                               
                   keep in mind how node code executes,
                   -------------------------------------
                               thatz it's not line after line but that it works with callbacks and is event driven and therefore if you want
                               to look into a callback, you have to add the breakpoint there and not right before it.
                               
                               
                               
Express
-------
               1.Middleware 
               ------------
                             -> comes between req and res
                             -> you can write some condition between req and res if that condition satisfy then only you wull recive response.
               2.Use()
               ------
                        Use allows us to add a new middleware function.it accepts an array of so-called request handlers here.
                        
                        Now one easy way of using it is that you simply pass a function here,                                                                                             this function you pass to app use will be executed for every incoming request.
                        
                        this function will receive three arguments,
                        
                        1.request
                        2.response object.
                        3.next()
                        
               3.next()
               ---------
                       Next is actually a function, a function that will be passed to this function by expressjs
                       
                       and this next argument, basically this function you're receiving here has to be executed to allow the
                       request to travel on to the next middleware.
                       
                       So this allows the request to continue to the next middleware in, whoops middleware in line which is the middleware
                       
                       And you should call next if you want to allow the request to go to the next function,.
                             
                               
                               
                               
               4. bodyParser alternative
               --------------------------
                                          
                                          app.use(expess.json())
